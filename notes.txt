Thank you for installing Basic Utilities 2.1.3!

Extra information:
It is reccomended that you uninstall this program from the program itself. There are some files that the uninstaller does not
get rid of. However, pre-uninstall.bat takes care of those.

What is new in this update (detailed)?

Added a Birthday Feature.
Users enter in ytheir birthmonth and day.
On startup, Basic Utilities checks its files to see if your birthday matches.
If it does, we wish you a Happy Birthday.
Modified pre-uninstall to support bday

Also I will try out the Github New Release thing

Fixed bugs:

[BU-0019] Program crashes on startup if it lacks write permissions
